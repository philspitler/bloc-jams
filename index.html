Git and GitHub are among a professional developer's most useful tools, so we mandate that Bloc students use them until they are an integral part of the student's process. We realize that these tools seem as complex as the programming language students learn. Furthermore, the time spent mastering them is time students may otherwise have spent coding, designing, or solving fun problems.

Therefore, we've provided this simple resource to assist students during their program. Before attempting any checkpoint or assignment, consult this document; it will remind you how to branch, add, commit, push, and merge your way to Git success.

Create a Repository

Before a developer writes their first line of code, they create a repository. To do so, navigate to this GitHub page. The repository's name should reflect the name of the application, project, or endeavor it aims to achieve. For your Bloc course work, the project title used in the curriculum is preferred: “Blocitoff,” ”BlocSpot,” etc.

Check the box to, “Initialize this repository with a README.” A .gitignore file helps developers exclude non-essential project files from their repositories. GitHub offers to initialize your repository with a ready-made .gitignore file. Click the “Add .gitignore: None” dropdown button, then select an option based on the type of project you're creating. Options suited for Bloc students include: Android, Objective-C, Swift, and Ruby.

Leave it set to None if you're building a Frontend project. GitHub does not provide a .gitignore for Angular projects.
